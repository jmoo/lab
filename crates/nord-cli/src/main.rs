//! `nord` — a thin CLI over [`nord_format`] and `nord_usb`, purely to dogfood them.
//!
//! Not a product; it exists to exercise the libraries and surface API friction.
//!
//! # The shape of the command tree
//!
//! **The noun set is the protocol's object-class set.** `nord program` and `nord setlist`
//! are the same code with the class fixed, sharing one verb vocabulary; `nord raw
//! --class N` is that parameter exposed. `nord device` is the instrument itself, and
//! `inspect`/`verify` are top level because they dispatch on the CBIN format tag rather
//! than on a class.
//!
//! ⚠️ **`raw` is hidden, not deprecated.** It must stay supported and tested: it is the
//! only way to reach a class that has no noun. Pianos (class 1) and samples (class 3)
//! have none, because no operation has ever run directly against either and a
//! `nord piano get` would look verified because its siblings are. A noun arrives when the
//! class has been exercised on hardware.
