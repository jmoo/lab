//! The transaction wrapper every operation runs inside.
//!
//! Each operation is enclosed by the same exchange sequence, independent of what the

//!
//! ```text
//! O18 I22, O22 I26, [ operation ], O22 I42, O18 I22, O18 I22
//! ```
//!
//! (Payload bytes. Captures quote frame lengths, which are 40 higher — that is the
//! sniffer's Darwin header, not anything on the wire.)
//!
//! # Why `commit()` and not `Drop`
//!
//! This is an RAII shape, and closing in `Drop` is still wrong: `Drop` can be neither
//! async nor fallible, so a failed close would be silently swallowed — unacceptable
//! where a half-open transaction may leave the device in an odd state. Closing is
//! explicit; `Drop` only *complains* in debug builds.
