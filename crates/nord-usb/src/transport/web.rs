//! Browser transport, via WebUSB (`navigator.usb`). Chrome/Edge only — Firefox and
//! Safari have declined the spec.
//!
//! ⚠️ **Not confirmed on hardware.** Nothing on this path has been run against an
//! instrument. Everything below about how the device or the browser behaves is
//! inferred from the WebUSB spec and from the `nusb` backend, which *is* confirmed;
//! treat a disagreement between the two as this file being wrong.
//!
//! # Enumeration is not here
//!
//! A page can only obtain a device from `navigator.usb.requestDevice()`, and that call
//! requires transient user activation — a click, in the page, that no library function
//! can manufacture. So device *selection* belongs to the page (`crates/nord-web-demo`
//! shows the whole ceremony) and this module starts from a [`UsbDevice`] the page
//! already has. That is the same split [`super::usb`] documents, arrived at from the
//! other direction: there, enumeration is host-specific; here, it is gesture-bound.
