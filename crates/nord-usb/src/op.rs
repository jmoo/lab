//!
//! These emit the command bytes NSM sends to *effect* an operation, including the
//! fire-and-forget progress strings that paint the instrument's own display
//! ([`ui::label`]/[`ui::percent`]). They deliberately omit the reads NSM issues purely
//! to repaint its **host-side browser** — the `INFO`/`DEPENDENCIES` refresh after a
//! copy, the `STATUS` counter re-read that closes each transaction, and the whole
//! bank-refresh transaction that follows a write. Those change nothing on the device;
//! reproducing a specific GUI's bookkeeping is not the library's job. Everything sent
//! here is verified byte-for-byte against the capture corpus.
