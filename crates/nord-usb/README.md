# nord-usb

Talk to **Clavia / Nord** keyboards over USB from Rust — the vendor protocol Nord
Sound Manager speaks, reverse-engineered from packet captures.

This is the transport-and-protocol half of the Nord toolkit.
[`nord-format`](../nord-format) owns the bytes of a file; this crate owns getting
those bytes on and off the instrument. It depends on `nord-format` for the
container it wraps read data in, and on nothing else at its core — the backends
are optional features.

## Layering

The protocol is testable without hardware, which is the whole point of the split:

| Module | Role |
|---|---|
| `wire` | Message framing and codec. Pure, no I/O. |
| `transport` | The byte pipe. The **only** part that touches a device. |
| `session` | The transaction wrapper every operation runs inside. |
| `op` | Typed operations. |

## The protocol

Every message on the vendor bulk endpoints is a length-prefixed, CRC-trailered
frame of **big-endian** `u32`s (the *file* formats are little-endian — mixing them
up is an easy afternoon lost):

```
┌────────┬─────────┬───────────┬─────────┬───────────────┬───────┐
│ length │ service │ subsystem │ command │ args…         │ crc16 │
│  u32   │   u32   │    u32    │   u32   │               │  u16  │
└────────┴─────────┴───────────┴─────────┴───────────────┴───────┘
```

The CRC is **CRC-16/CCITT-FALSE**. A response is the request's command `+ 1` with
a `u32` status inserted ahead of the echoed arguments, which is why responses run
exactly four bytes longer.

**Verified against all 4,589 messages in the capture corpus** — 100% CRC match,
100% length-field match.

Two things that cost real time and are worth knowing up front:

- **Requests are not reliably even.** `SELECT` is `0x2f` with response `0x30`.
  Direction is the only dependable discriminator, so this crate records it at
  decode time rather than inferring it. Getting that wrong misaligns every
  argument by four bytes and hides device error codes.
- **Operations are primitives parameterised by an object class**, not per-type
  opcodes. `SESSION_OPEN` carries the class (1 piano, 3 sample, 4 program, 5 set
  list, 6 live, 7 settings) and the same `rename` / `move` / `delete` / `copy`
  commands then apply to whichever it is.

## Usage

```rust
use nord_usb::{op, Location, ObjectClass, Session};
use nord_usb::transport::UsbTransport;

let mut transport = UsbTransport::open_first()?;

// Read-only by default — the type system will not let a mutating op through.
// `from_user` takes the instrument's own one-indexed numbering: 7:4 on the panel.
let mut session = Session::open(&mut transport, ObjectClass::Program).await?;
let at = Location::from_user(7, 4);
let info = op::info(&mut session, at).await?;
let file = op::read_program(&mut session, at).await?;
session.commit().await?;
```

Mutating operations need the capability to be asked for explicitly:

```rust
let mut session = Session::open(&mut t, ObjectClass::Program)
    .await?
    .allow_destructive_writes();
op::delete(&mut session, at).await?;
session.commit().await?;
```

**Always `commit()`, including on the error path.** The closing exchanges are what
clear the instrument's progress display; abandoning a transaction after a progress
label has been sent leaves the device stuck until it is power-cycled. `Session`
carries a `Drop` assertion to catch the mistake in debug builds.

## Features

| Feature | Default | What it gives you |
|---|:--:|---|
| `nusb` | ✅ | Desktop backend — macOS (IOKit), Linux (usbfs), Windows (WinUSB). Pure Rust. |
| `web` | | Browser backend over WebUSB. **Hardware-verified for the read-only path** (Chrome/macOS: inventory, object info); writes and bulk reads not yet exercised. Chrome/Edge only — Firefox and Safari declined the spec. |
| `replay` | | Drive the protocol from committed captures, no hardware. Used by the golden tests. |
| `blocking` | | Block on the async API from synchronous callers (the CLI). Tiny; not a runtime. |
| `corpus` | | Exchange-shape tests over the capture corpus (`NORD_CORPUS_DIR`), implies `replay`. |

### Portability

WebUSB is the binding constraint on the API shape. Its handles are not `Send`, so
neither is this crate's `Transport` trait — which in turn keeps it
runtime-agnostic. Device *enumeration* is deliberately backend-specific rather
than part of the portable core, because the browser requires a user gesture to
pick a device and no portable signature can express that.

Building the `web` feature needs `--cfg=web_sys_unstable_apis` (WebUSB is still
gated in `web-sys`); `crates/.cargo/config.toml` supplies it for the wasm target,
so wasm builds must be run from `crates/` or below.
[`nord-web-demo`](../nord-web-demo) is a page that drives this backend on hardware.

`block_on` exists for CLIs and tests that just want the answer, without pulling in
a full async runtime.

## Testing

The golden tests replay real captures through the whole stack and assert the
bytes this crate emits are **the bytes NSM sent** — not merely self-consistent
with its own encoder. No hardware, no platform dependency.

`tests/corpus_shapes.rs` adds the other 30 captures, which the corpus commits as
**exchange shapes** — the payload size of every frame, not its bytes. Driving the
operations NSM performed through this crate's own `Session`/`op` primitives has to
emit exactly the frame sizes the capture holds. That checks framing and structure,
never argument values; values are the golden replays' job.

```sh
cargo test -p nord-usb --features replay

NORD_CORPUS_DIR=/path/to/nord-corpus \
  cargo test -p nord-usb --features corpus

# Everything both crates have, which is what a change should be run against:
NORD_CORPUS_DIR=/path/to/nord-corpus \
  cargo test --workspace --features nord-usb/replay,nord-format/corpus

# With nix
nix build .#checks.<system>.nord-usb-corpus
```

⚠️ `replay` is not a default feature, so a bare `cargo test -p nord-usb` compiles
the golden tests out and reports a pass having verified none of the wire encoding.
The Nix build enables it via `[package.metadata.nix] testFeatures` in `Cargo.toml`,
and `tests/replay_guard.rs` fails the run when `NORD_CORPUS_DIR` is set without it.

## Status

> [!CAUTION]
> # 🚫 DO NOT USE THIS IN ITS CURRENT STATE 🚫

> This crate drives real hardware over a reverse-engineered protocol and is
> pre-1.0. Do not point it at a Nord device you care about.

The wire protocol is decoded and validated. Implemented and hardware-verified on
macOS: inventory, object info, dependencies, program read/write, the slot
organisation set (move, delete, rename, duplicate, select), and reads of the
live slots (class 6) and the settings singleton (class 7). Writes of those two
classes are unproven — whether either survives the delete-then-write sequence is
unconfirmed on hardware, so nothing here has attempted one.

The WebUSB backend is hardware-verified for the read-only path (Chrome on macOS:
inventory and object info, via `nord-web-demo`); its writes and multi-chunk bulk
reads have not been exercised.

Not implemented: bundle and backup transfer, firmware update, and the piano/sample
library as first-class objects. Linux and Windows build and pass the replay tests
but have not been run against hardware.
