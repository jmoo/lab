# nord-format

Parse and write **Clavia / Nord** keyboard binary file formats from Rust.

This is the pure format-logic crate of the Nord toolkit: the `CBIN` container,
the CRC-32 (ISO-HDLC) range checksum, and per-model entity layouts. It depends
only on [`binrw`] (plus `zip` behind the `bundle` feature for backup bundles) and
does no USB, OS, or I/O beyond `Read`/`Seek`/`Write` — so it's trivially testable
against a specimen corpus and reusable by higher layers (a device/USB crate, a
CLI) without dragging in a transport stack.

## What it handles

| Format | Parse | Write (byte-exact) | Semantic decode |
|---|:--:|:--:|---|
| `ne5p` program | ✅ | ✅ | Center / piano / sample / FX / EQ panels ✅. **Organ**: drawbars, preset, vibrato/chorus (all models) and B3 percussion ✅ — B3-bass & Farfisa drawbar *display* transforms still pending. |
| `ne5t` song / set | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (four program slots) |
| `ne5l` live slot | ✅ | ✅ | Same as `ne5p` — the live buffer is the program body under another tag (confirmed on hardware), so it shares the program schema in the three live slots. |
| `ne5s` settings | ✅ | ✅ | System / MIDI / Sound menus plus the power-up selection ✅ — 32 of the 34 catalogued settings are pinned by a change-one-setting hardware sweep; memory protect and local control move no bit of the body and stay undecoded. |
| `npno` piano / `nsmp` sample | ✅ (header) | ⬜ header only | Only the header is parsed and re-emitted, so a full library file does **not** round-trip yet — `nord verify` on one reports the truncation. |
| backup bundle (ZIP) | ✅ | — | Partial; behind the `bundle` feature. |

Everything that parses **round-trips byte-for-byte**, verified against a
change-one-knob specimen corpus.

## Usage

```rust
use nord_format::{from_path, Entity, Program};
use nord_format::common::bank::Item; // for `.location()`
use nord_format::electro5::OrganModel;

let entity = from_path("patch.ne5p")?;

if let Entity::Program(Program::Electro5(p)) = entity {
    println!("location: {:?}", p.location());
    println!("lower/upper: {:?} / {:?}", p.lower_part(), p.upper_part());

    // Organ state is decoded per model + selected preset:
    let preset = p.organ().preset(OrganModel::B3);
    println!("B3 drawbars: {:?}", p.organ().drawbars(OrganModel::B3, preset));
    println!("B3 vibrato:  {:?}", p.organ().vib_type(OrganModel::B3));
}
```

`from_path` / `from_stream` sniff the container and return an [`Entity`]; the
`electro5` module holds the concrete `Program`/`Song`/`Settings` layouts and the
`OrganModel` / `VibChorus` / `PercSpeed` decode types.

## Lossless round-trip is the core invariant

Unknown regions are kept as **raw byte blocks** and decoded values are exposed as
read-only views over them, so `parse → write` is byte-identical even where the
semantics are incomplete. Every newly decoded field is a safe, incremental
refinement — never a risk to the write path.

## Features

- **`bundle`** — ZIP-based backup bundles (pulls in the `zip` stack). Off by
  default so parse-only consumers stay lean; enable with `--features bundle`.
- **`corpus`** — *test-only*. Gates the corpus-backed integration tests
  (`tests/corpus_cases.rs` and friends); see below.

## Tests

Unit tests live inline (`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`) and run on a plain `cargo test`,
alongside `tests/fixtures.rs` — a set of small **synthetic** specimens in
`tests/fixtures/`, emitted by this crate's own writers, which give a fresh clone a
parse / round-trip / checksum suite with no corpus at all. Their filenames are the
oracle, and `cargo test -p nord-format --test fixtures -- --ignored bless` rewrites
the bytes from the generator.

The **corpus integration suite** is gated behind the `corpus` feature because it needs
the specimen corpus, which lives in a separate private repo (`jmoo/nord-corpus`).
`tests/corpus_cases.rs` is a `libtest-mimic` harness reporting one case per specimen
(`<check>/<path under the corpus root>`), so a failure names the file, all failures
surface in one run, and a `.skip.` specimen shows up as an ignored case. `tests/ne5.rs`
holds what a per-specimen harness cannot express — a named specimen read field by
field, and the assertions that span the whole corpus.

```sh
cargo test -p nord-format                       # minimal suite (inline unit tests)

# Full corpus sweep — point NORD_CORPUS_DIR at a nord-corpus checkout root:
NORD_CORPUS_DIR=/path/to/nord-corpus \
  cargo test -p nord-format --features corpus

# Everything both crates have, which is what a change should be run against:
NORD_CORPUS_DIR=/path/to/nord-corpus \
  cargo test --workspace --features nord-usb/replay,nord-format/corpus

# With nix
nix build .#checks.<system>.nord-format-corpus
```

`tests/corpus_rev.txt` names the corpus revision the suite is blessed against, and
`corpus_dir()` refuses a checkout sitting anywhere else — see `tests/common/mod.rs`.
`tests/corpus_guard.rs` runs under every feature set and fails when `NORD_CORPUS_DIR`
is set without `--features corpus`, since that run verifies none of the decode.

## Where this fits

This project started in 2023 as my personal 'learn rust' project. The goal was to be able to read/write clavia files for my electro 5. After I got most of the ne5 formats RE'd, I got a new job that was pretty demanding and I didn't have much free time to continue.

The goal now is to finish reverse engineering ne5 files, add support for more models, and to reverse engineer the USB protocol. The end game is to have a portable toolkit that could be the foundation of an open source nord manager alternative with linux support.

## Current State

Messy and incomplete but solid for reading and writing electro 5 files due to lossless round trips and large test corpus.
Nord Electro 5 Program, Song, Live and Settings files are nearly 100% solved for the file versions I've encountered, and the library safely errors when
encountering unexpected files or versions. Bundles, backups, piano, and sample files are still incomplete.

Expect refactoring, API changes, and other misc changes until a stable version is released. I would also like to support
more nord models, but will not work on those until I'm 100% satisfied with the Electro 5 support.

## Prior art

 Shout out to @Chris55. I wish I had discovered his work before I started. It would have made some of the initial reverse engineering easier. Once I finish decoding the ne5, I plan to contribute the ICD back to these projects.

Why maintain a separate project? Primarily because this is a rust learning project for me and I've written enough js in my life to not really want to write it in my free time. Also, the goal of this project are r/w + usb, not just read.
