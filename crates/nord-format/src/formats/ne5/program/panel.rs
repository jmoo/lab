//! The Electro 5 program as its panel is divided.
//!
//! The body keeps every organ model's registration and both parts' settings at once, so
//! most of it is state rather than controls: what the instrument is *using* is decided by
//! the part selectors and the organ model, and that is what the conditions here say.
//!
//! Reading order is the panel's, left to right: the keyboard section leads because its
//! part pickers decide which engine sections mean anything, and a picker that brings a
//! section back must never be inside the section it brings back.
