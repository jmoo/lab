//! The Stage 4 program as its panel is divided.
//!
//! Three sections, each with its layers, each layer with its own effects chain — the
//! shape the body's nested bodies already have, plus the two things they do not say:
//! which layer's fields are the ones the instrument is playing, and where the loose
//! fields at the top level belong.
//!
//! A layer's enable and volume are **not** in its nested body — the file packs those with
//! the other layers' — so each layer's group names them beside the body's own fields.
//! Morph slots are named by nothing: 354 of this body's 878 fields are morph targets, and
//! each belongs to the parameter its name binds it to.
