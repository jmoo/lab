//! Body layouts as data.
//!
//! `#[bitbody]` generates an implementation of [`BodyLayout`] alongside the codec,
//! so a body's bit map exists once in the source and is readable at runtime — for
//! generated documentation, for `nord inspect`, for anything that wants to answer
//! "which bits does this field own" without re-stating the layout. Nested bodies
//! chain to their own layouts, so the whole map is one recursive walk.

/// One field's placement: an inclusive bit range, MSB-first from byte 0 of the
/// body that declares it. For the file offset a hex dump shows, add the enclosing
/// placements and the container's body start — `0x2c` on a type-1 file, `0x18` on
/// a type-0.
