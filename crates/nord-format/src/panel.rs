//! What a body's fields *are* to a player: which controls sit together, and which of
//! them the instrument is using for the state the file holds.
//!
//! The field registry answers where a field sits, what it accepts and what kind of
//! control it is. Three things it cannot answer, because none of them is a property of a
//! placement:
//!
//! - **Order.** The registry lists fields in bit order, so an organ layer's nine drawbars
//!   need not be adjacent and a knob need not follow the switch that arms it.
//! - **Grouping.** A dotted prefix is the only structure a path carries, and a body as
//!   flat as the Electro 5 program has one prefix per panel and nothing below it.
//! - **Relevance.** Which controls the instrument is actually using is *stateful*: an
//!   Electro 5 keeps every organ model's registration and plays one, a Stage keeps every
//!   layer and enables some.
//!
//! A [`Panel`] states all three, as data, per format. It is hand-authored — semantics
//! cannot be derived from bit placement — and it is inspectable and testable rather than
//! a pile of closures.
//!
//! # What a caller may rely on
//!
//! - [`of`] answers for a decoded file, and answers `None` where nobody has authored a
//!   layout. **Absence is normal**: a caller falls back to whatever it does today, and no
//!   format is required to have one.
//! - A [`Group`] names its members in **reading order** — the order the panel puts them
//!   in, not the order the bits do.
//! - A path a group names is a real registry path of that body, and no path is named
//!   twice. A test in this module holds both against every layout the crate ships, so a
//!   layout cannot quietly rot as a body gains fields.
//! - [`Panel::exhaustive`] says whether the groups account for every registered field. If
//!   it is false, [`Panel::leftovers`] is the rest, and a caller still has somewhere to
//!   put them.
//! - A morph slot is **not** named by any group: it belongs to the parameter it morphs,
//!   which the group names, and [`FieldSpec::morph_parent`] resolves the relation. This
//!   is why a Stage body with 354 morph slots needs a layout of a hundred-odd lines
//!   rather than five hundred.
//!
//! # Relevance is not visibility
//!
//! [`Group::is_relevant`] answers one question: *for the state this file holds, is the
//! instrument using these controls?* A group that is not relevant is still state the file
//! carries and still writable — an organ registration for a model that is not selected is
//! kept, not cleared. Whether that means hidden, dimmed, or shown behind a fold is the
//! caller's decision, and it may reasonably differ by depth: a whole section nobody is
//! playing is worth hiding, where the second of two registrations is worth showing
//! quietly.
//!
//! A condition is a set of value matches, any one of which satisfies it, and a nested
//! group is relevant only if its parent is — so a disjunction is a wider condition and a
//! conjunction is another level of nesting. That is deliberately less than a predicate
//! language: every condition stays comparable, printable and checkable against the
//! field's own legal values.
