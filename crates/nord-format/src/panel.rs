//! Field-level introspection over a bit-packed panel.
//!
//! [`Panel`] lets a caller walk a panel's fields without naming any of them, which is
//! what the decode snapshot needs: a new field appears in the output by being declared,
//! not by anyone remembering to add it. [`Panel::set_field`] is the same idea in the
//! write direction — a field becomes settable by being declared, so a CLI cannot fall
//! behind the library.
//!
//! Both halves of the snapshot's view of a [`FieldValue`] matter. `raw` is the field's
//! bits with no type applied, so it pins the placement — move a range by one bit and it
//! changes on nearly every specimen. `value` is the decoded rendering, so it pins the
//! interpretation. A change to either is visible, and they fail in different places.
