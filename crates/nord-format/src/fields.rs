//! Field-level introspection over a `#[bitbody]`'s fields.
//!
//! The generated registry lets a caller walk a body's fields without naming any of
//! them, which is what the decode snapshot needs: a new field appears in the output
//! by being declared, not by anyone remembering to add it. `set_field` is the same
//! idea in the write direction — a field becomes settable by being declared, so a
//! CLI cannot fall behind the library.
//!
//! Both halves of the snapshot's view of a [`FieldValue`] matter. `raw` is the field's
//! bits with no type applied, so it pins the placement — move a range by one bit and it
//! changes on nearly every specimen. `value` is the decoded rendering, so it pins the
//! interpretation. A change to either is visible, and they fail in different places.
